# Cosmic Monolith

An interactive WebGL artwork that explores the intersection of geometric precision and cosmic chaos. A tall, black rhombus rotates in space, its reflective surfaces catching glimpses of the surrounding cosmic environment. The contrast between the sharp, mathematical perfection of the rhombus and the organic, flowing nature of the space background creates a meditation on order and chaos in the universe.

## Technical Details

The artwork is implemented using WebGL and custom GLSL shaders:

- **Space Background**: 
  - Dynamic nebula effect created through layered noise functions
  - Animated stars with subtle movement patterns
  - Rich purple cosmic atmosphere

- **Geometric Element**:
  - Perfect rhombus geometry with equal edges
  - Black reflective surface with subtle highlights
  - Continuous smooth rotation
  - Real-time 3D rendering with proper perspective

- **Interaction**:
  - Responsive full-screen design
  - Automatic window resize handling
  - Smooth animation at 60 FPS

## Implementation

Built using:
- WebGL for 3D rendering
- Custom GLSL shaders for visual effects
- JavaScript for animation and control
- CSS for full-screen canvas setup
